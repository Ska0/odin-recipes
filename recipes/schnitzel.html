    <h4>Pork Schnitzel</h4>
    <p>
      Most Americans associate Schnitzel with Wienerschnitzel. “Wienerschnitzel”
      is actually a geographically protected term in Germany and Austria and can
      only be made with veal. This traditional German Schnitzel is prepared the
      same way as Austrian Wiener Schnitzel. The only difference – German
      Schnitzel is made with pork (my preference) instead of veal. As for where
      the Schnitzel originally came from…the technique of breading and frying
      thin cuts of meat is attributed to the Romans from around 1 BC. Another
      little tidbit: Austrians will be the first to admit that Wienerschnitzel
      doesn’t come from Wien (Vienna).

    <p>
      But whether it’s Schweineschnitzel or Wienerschnitzel, when it’s perfectly
      breaded, perfectly fried, and perfectly crispy, practically everyone loves
      a good Schnitzel! And now you can make it – perfectly – in your own
      kitchen!

    <u><h2>Directions</h2></u>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <b>Get the dredging station ready:</b> Prepare 3 shallow bowls (or a
        bowl for the egg and one plate each for the flour and panko).
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        <b>Pound the pork thin: </b>Place the pork chops between two sheets of
        plastic wrap and pound them until they’re 1/4″ thick (or even thinner)
        using the flat side of a meat mallet. Season them generously with salt &
        pepper.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        <b>Prepare the skillet for frying:</b> Add 2 tablespoons of olive oil
        and 1 tablespoon of butter to a large skillet. The pan should be well
        coated, so add more oil if needed. Let the pan heat up for a few minutes
        over medium-high heat. You will be doing two batches, so for the second
        batch add at least one more tablespoon of olive oil to the pan and the
        remaining tablespoon of butter.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        <b>Dredge the pork:</b> Coat the pork chops in flour, followed by the
        egg (let excess drip off), and finally the panko breadcrumbs (you may
        need to gently pat it down to make them stick).
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        <b>Time to fry!</b> Fry two schnitzels at a time for about 3
        minutes/side. Easily flip them using cooking tongs. If the pan starts to
        smoke, turn the heat down a bit. Repeat with the next batch (add
        remaining oil and butter).
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        <b>Serve & enjoy.</b> Schnitzels are best enjoyed with lemon wedges.
      </li>
